Youtube video to mp3 converter for sampling music. 

About:
Often when finding samples for music from youtube we have to go through a  website with tons of ads to convert the video to a usable mp3, it takes a minute or two to download, and then we need to shift through our downloads folder to finally move the sample to another folder to get to Ableton or our DAW of preference. 

Current:
This simple app using python3, tkinter, and youtube_dl has a create gui you can copy paste a url into and get to downloading. Currently, you just paste the link, click 'Get Sample!', the mp3 will automatically start downloading, and when complete the link to the video will show underneath and most importantly the mp3 will show up in the same folder as your src.py.
